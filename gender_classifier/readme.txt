* Description
The purpose of the project is to classify images by gender (man's handwriting or woman's handwriting)
by training an SVM model with different parameters and kernels.

* Environment
* Describe the OS and compilation requirements needed to compile and run the program
* How to Run Your Program
1) Before running the code:
    • Make sure you have the necessary images in picture folders in HHD_gender [1].
    • Make sure you have python version 3.10.8
    • Install numpy using pip install numpy
    • Install sklearn using pip install sklearn
    • Install skimage using pip install skimage
    • Make sure that you are in the folder where the classifier.py is

2) To run this program, enter the following into the command prompt:

    python classifier.py <path_of_train_folder> <path_of_val_folder> <path_of_test_folder>
