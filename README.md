## Gender Classification from Handwriting
Classifying a manuscript according to the gender of the writer.
Automatic classification of the writer's gender is an essential task in a wide variety of fields, for example, psychology, classification of historical documents or criminological analysis. Psychological studies of handwriting analysis have confirmed that gender classification can be made according to a number of significant differences in handwriting. In general, while a woman's handwriting tends to be more uniform, neat and circular, a man's handwriting tends to be more pointed, messy and slanted.

The purpose of the project is to train an SVM model for the automatic classification of a handwriting image according to the gender of the writer.
To do this, we will perform experiments with different parameters and kernels, and report which combination of parameters achieves the highest accuracy

The HDD_gender dataset was used to train the model. This dataset contains around 850 samples of Hebrew handwriting together with their labels.

### Samples from the gender_HHD dataset
 | ![HDD_gender_example_1](https://github.com/Andrey-Ruch/Python-projects/assets/73066767/b7455ec4-eb8f-4101-b474-fc7b6eae413b?raw=true) |
 |:--:| 
 | *Left - A man's handwriting / Right - A woman's handwriting* |

### Result
    Values of the parameters that give the highest accuracy:
    - Radius = 3
    - Number of points = 24
    - kernel = linear, with parameters: SVC(kernel='linear')

    Accuracy: 81.43%

    Confusion matrix:
            |  male  |  female  
    ----------------------------
      male  |   29   |    6     
    ----------------------------
     female |   7    |    28     

 ### Getting Started
 1) Before running the code:
    * Make sure you have the necessary images folders from gender_HHD dataset [1]
    * Make sure you have python version 3.10.8
    * Install numpy using pip install numpy
    * Install sklearn using pip install sklearn
    * Install skimage using pip install skimage
    * Make sure that you are in the folder where the classifier.py is

2) To run this program, enter the following into the command prompt:

    * python classifier.py <path_of_train_images_folder> <path_of_val_folder> <path_of_test_folder>

## Classifier for Handwritten Hebrew Letters
The purpose of the project is to classify images of letters from the HHD_0 dataset, which consists of handwritten letters in Hebrew.
For this we will train the KNN classifier for letter classification×¥

The HHD_v0 dataset contains around 5000 images of individual letters. These images are divided into 27 subgroups (subfolders). Each folder contains images of a certain letter from the Hebrew alphabet. [Details about the dataset](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343880780_The_HHD_Dataset).

 ## Background replacement
 The purpose of the project is to change the background for a photo taken with a green screen.
